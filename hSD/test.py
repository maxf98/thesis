'''Example of VAE on MNIST dataset using MLP

The VAE has a modular design. The encoder, decoder and VAE
are 3 models that share weights. After training the VAE model,
the encoder can be used to  generate latent vectors.
The decoder can be used to generate MNIST digits by sampling the
latent vector from a Gaussian distribution with mean=0 and std=1.
